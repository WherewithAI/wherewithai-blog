## Series Overview

This series provides deep technical dives into diffusion models, one of the most exciting developments in generative AI. We explore the mathematical foundations, implementation details, and cutting-edge research in score-based generative modeling.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Stochastic differential equations and reverse-time diffusion
- Score matching and denoising objectives
- Guidance techniques and conditional generation
- Connections to variational inference and optimal transport
- Efficient sampling and acceleration methods

### The Power of Diffusion

Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling by providing a principled framework for learning complex data distributions. Through careful analysis of the forward and reverse processes, we can understand how these models achieve state-of-the-art results across modalities.
